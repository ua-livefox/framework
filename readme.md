# LiveCMS: Modern and Lightweight Engine

## Advantages

### 1. Lightweight and Efficient
LiveCMS is a clean and minimalist core, free from excessive libraries or frameworks. This ensures high performance and avoids unnecessary code, making the project fast and easy to manage.

### 2. Modern Technologies
The engine is built on object-oriented programming (OOP), allowing for easy functionality expansion. The interface uses jQuery AJAX to provide quick user interactions, reducing server load and simplifying development.

### 3. Security and Reliability
Each system file of the engine undergoes strict checks for errors and vulnerabilities, ensuring stable and secure operation of your project.

### 4. Ease of Management
You donâ€™t need to be a programmer to manage a site on LiveCMS. Installing components, themes, and languages is done through the built-in installer, and flexible system settings allow you to quickly adapt the site to your needs.

### 5. Updates
The engine is regularly updated with new features and improvements. All updates are completely free!

### 6. Responsive Design
LiveCMS supports cross-browser compatibility and is adapted for use on computers, tablets, and smartphones. You can also easily change the design by installing new themes through the control panel.

### 7. Multilingual Support
Currently, LiveCMS supports two languages: Russian and English. Additional languages can be installed via the control panel using the installer.
